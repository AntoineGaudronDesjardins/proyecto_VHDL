2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net debouncing_inst/futuro__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin debouncing_inst/FSM_onehot_futuro_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell debouncing_inst/FSM_onehot_futuro_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net debouncing_inst1/futuro__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin debouncing_inst1/FSM_onehot_futuro_reg[3]_i_2__0/O, cell debouncing_inst1/FSM_onehot_futuro_reg[3]_i_2__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net debouncing_inst2/futuro__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin debouncing_inst2/FSM_onehot_futuro_reg[3]_i_2__1/O, cell debouncing_inst2/FSM_onehot_futuro_reg[3]_i_2__1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net gestor_escritura_inst/futuro__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin gestor_escritura_inst/FSM_onehot_futuro_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell gestor_escritura_inst/FSM_onehot_futuro_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net gestor_lectura_inst/READ_FIFO__0_n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin gestor_lectura_inst/READ_FIFO__0/O, cell gestor_lectura_inst/READ_FIFO__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net gestor_lectura_inst/SENTIDO_reg_i_2_n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin gestor_lectura_inst/SENTIDO_reg_i_2/O, cell gestor_lectura_inst/SENTIDO_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#7 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net gestor_lectura_inst/START__0_n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin gestor_lectura_inst/START__0/O, cell gestor_lectura_inst/START__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#8 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net gestor_lectura_inst/futuro is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin gestor_lectura_inst/futuro_inferred__0/i_/O, cell gestor_lectura_inst/futuro_inferred__0/i_. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#9 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net motor_stepper_inst/FINISHED_reg_i_1_n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin motor_stepper_inst/FINISHED_reg_i_1/O, cell motor_stepper_inst/FINISHED_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#10 Warning
